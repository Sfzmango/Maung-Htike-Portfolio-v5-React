                                going green while also saving them money on their electricity bill. I work with the customer to try
                                to fulfill their needs and goals for solar. Not only do I have to generate leads, but I also have to
                                prepare a design proposal with our upstream and downstream partners for the customer and negotiate
                                with them to close a deal that they are happy with. After an agreement has been signed off, I follow
                                up with the customers and our partners occasionally for status updates and, if possible, to expedite
                                them up the schedule until the solar system has been given “Permission To Operate.”

                                technicians at night to put solar panels through various different tests which measured
                                their efficiency in a varity of aspects. For example, in one of the tests, we used a
                                dremel
                                to expose the backside of a solar panel and solder certain joints together to isolate
                                individual cells. Occasionally I worked with upstream and downstream customers to help
                                facilitate the logistics side of the testing process. My company would send me on work
                                related trips to places such as Texas to inspect and test the solar plant’s solar
